# Example SDK from Try-It-Out during Module 2

The `Optional Task` step 19 generates the SDK for the `example` API of the `pet store`.

* Folder `apiGateway-js-sdk` is the result of the zip file that is created for that SDK in JavaScript.
* Folder `aws-apiGateway-ios` is the result of the zip file that is created for that SDK in IOS in Objective C.

We cannot create an SDK for the `bakery` example because it is an `HTTP` API. SDKs can only be generated for `REST` APIs.

**NOTE:** the README markdown files have been massaged to eliminate link warnings and be more readable as actual markdown in general.
